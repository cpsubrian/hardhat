**Scaffolding utility for blue-collar programmers.**


About / Why?
------------
There are a few other scaffolding libraries out there, some more recently
updated than others.  One thing most of them share in common is that they all do
a little too much.

I don't need option parsing, I can use optimist.

I don't need a command prompt library, prompt already takes care of that.

I don't need cli routing, I'm happy to use flatiron/director.

HardHat aims to solve some very specific problems and just be another
tool in your overall command-line application.

If you need a full-featured scaffolding solution you should go check out
some of the others like:


Features
--------

  * Copy a directory of scaffold folders & files (templates) to a
    new destination.
  * Your templates can be written using any engine that consolidate supports
    (currently 14 engines including jade, handlebars, etc.)
  * More?  Pull requests welcome :)


Installation
------------
### Install via npm (node package manager) ###
`[sudo] npm install hardhat`


Usage
